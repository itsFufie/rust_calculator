# rust practicing with piston api

yeah I dont know why im making this but for some reason this is what Im doing I guess :3

Also the point of this is not to achieve anything but to learn and practice the syntax of this language while making it interesting for my neurodivergent brain so yeah dont mind the lack of a point in this repository

## Chapter 1 

I decided to play around with physics, my main goal now is to get like simple shapes and make them move around, maybe implement some sort of gravity also, I think that will be fun to see! 

## Chapter 2 

I completely ignored the physics thing, you can see I started doing that cause the files are still there, but I just went sorta like "hey, minefield fun!" and started a minefield thing, so I guess thats what Im doing now
